# EQWorks data visualization exercise
My work for the EQWorks Application Development Track assignment.

Built with Next.js, tRPC and Prisma

What has been done:
- Migrated EQWorks API from Express to tRPC using Prisma.
- Implemented custom middleware for rate limiting API routes using LRU cache.
- Responsive UI with ability to add and remove charts for comparison.
- Automatic saving of user workspaces in local storage.
- Interactive data visualizations using line charts from Chart.js.
- Dynamic chart axis for consistency when displaying multiple charts.
